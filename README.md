# NLP-Codes
NLP codes used for illustration in the NLP training hosted in my youtube channel DataScience Cafe
I will mostly be using the R package Quanteda along with some data manipulation packages. For Topic Modeling (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) I will be using some additional packages which are mentioned in the respective codes. Codes are fairly flexible so feel free to customize if you want to.
